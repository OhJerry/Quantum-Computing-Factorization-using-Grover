# Quantum-Computing-Factorization-using-Grover
As quantum computing gradually comes to maturity, people are getting concerned if quantum computing can easily deci- pher any data encrypted in large-number factorization based systems with quantum advantages, thus ruin the entire Inter- net by destroying all online-safety. Although it does not seem a nightmare that would come true in the near future, differ- ent approaches to the factorization problem, the key to major modern world asymmetric encryption techniques, have been studied and implemented based on quantum computing for a long time. In this paper, we are to introduce four different methods of quantum factorization and their state-of-the-art results. Sub- sequently we manage to extend the ability of Grover’s algo- rithm on factorization by factorizing the number 9975814637 with 2 qubits implemented on IBM Quantum Experience, and conduct fidelity check to ensure reliability of test result. Result proves the success of our attempt: we observe good agreement between experimental and theoretical results with high fidelity. At last we will discuss the result, limitation of Grover’s algorithm and as well as impact of quantum factorization on encryption.
